# Google Books API Project

This project fetches data from the Google Books API and displays information about books, including their title, author, image, and a button that allows users to view more details about the book. The layout is responsive and uses a grid to display books in a neat, organized way.

## Features

- Fetches book data from the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books).
- Displays book title, author, and cover image.
- Includes a "View Book" button that opens the book's detailed page in a new tab.
- Responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes (4 books per row on large screens, 3 on medium, 2 on small, and 1 on very small screens).
- Clean, modern card design for each book.

## Files Structure

The project is composed of three main files:

1. **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure and the JavaScript code to fetch and display the books.
2. **styles.css**: Contains the CSS to style the page, including the grid layout, book cards, and button.
